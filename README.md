# Spotify Playlist Organizer
A playlist organizer for Spotify that creates a new playlist containing sorted tracks from the provided playlist. The new playlist has the same title, description, and cover image as the source playlist, besides (Sorted) appended to the title.

## Sorting procedure:
Step 1: Sort by album
Step 2: Sort by # of songs from album
Step 3: Sort by artist
Step 4: sort by # of songs from artist (in descending order)

## Sorted playlist example:
{Track name} from Album x by Artist 2 <br>
{Track name} from Album x by Artist 2 <br>
{Track name} from Album x by Artist 2 <br>
{Track name} from Album y by Artist 2 <br>
